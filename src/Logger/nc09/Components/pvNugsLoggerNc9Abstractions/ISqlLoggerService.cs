/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This interface represents a specialized logging service that combines the full functionality of
/// <see cref="ILoggerService"/> with SQL database-specific capabilities. It provides both standard

/// <para>
/// Implementations of this interface should provide:

/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>All standard logging capabilities from the base <see cref="ILoggerService"/></item>
/// <item>SQL database-specific log storage with proper indexing and performance optimization</item>
/// <item>Configurable retention policies for automated log management</item>
/// <item>Transaction safety and error handling for database operations</item>
/// <item>Support for high-volume logging scenarios</item>

    /// This method provides automated log maintenance by removing old entries based on configurable retention policies.
    /// It's designed to be run periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) to prevent log tables from growing indefinitely.

    /// <strong>Default Behavior:</strong> When <paramref name="retainDic"/> is null, the implementation should
    /// use default retention policies configured during service setup. These defaults typically provide
    /// longer retention for critical/error logs and shorter retention for informational/debug logs.
